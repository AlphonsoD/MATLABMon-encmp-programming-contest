To play my game, please run the Programming_Contest_V4.m file and
make sure the battle.m function file is in the Current Folder that
MATLAB reads files from as well.

The game is played entirely in the command window. The dialogue will progress
itself, and all the player needs to do is input the appropriate number when 
prompted, e.g. "Enter 1 to continue: " or "Select a move: " followed by a list
of possible moves that are numbered. 

I hope you enjoy the game!
